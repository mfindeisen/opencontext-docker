README:

Solr 5 and 6 have somewhat different schemas because of updates and changes made to Solr 6.
It would be great to offer a choice in deploying Open Context between Solr 5.x and Solr 6.x,
so we've broken the schema documents into too different folders. 

It would also be great to actually TEST these different deployments...
